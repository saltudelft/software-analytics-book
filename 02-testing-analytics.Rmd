## Motivation
Imagine playing a game and out of a sudden the application freezes. This is one of the scenarios
of a bug in a program. Such unexpected events can be frustrating and could even lead to damages if
a bug is encountered during, for example, a transaction on a webshop. To prevent bugs, developers
should make tests, such as unit tests or integration tests. However, in practice it seems that not
all developers test actively. In this paper we will survey on the use of testing and the tools that
make this possible. We will also look into the future development of tools that is done or required
in order to improve testing practices in real-world applications.
The above example could have prevented by making tests but is not guaranteed to do so. Testing is
not the holy grail for completely removing all bugs from a program but it can decrease the chances
for a user to encounter a bug. We believe that extra research is needed to ease the life of
developers by making testing more efficient, easier to maintain and more effective. Therefore, we
wanted to write a survey on the testing behavior, current practices and future developments of
testing.
In order to perform our survey, we formulated three Research Questions (RQs):

* **RQ1** How do developers currently tests?
* **RQ2** What state of the art technologies are being used?
* **RQ3** What future developments can be expect?
In this paper we will first elaborate on te research protocol that was used in order to find papers
and extract information for the survey. Second, the the actual findings for each of the research
questions will be explained.

## Research protocol
For this paper Kitchenham's survey method was applied. For this method a protocol has to be
specified. This protocol is defined for the research questions given above. Below the inclusion
and exclusion criteria are given, which helped finding the rightful papers. After these criteria,
the actual search for papers is described. The papers that were found are listed and after they
are tested against the critiria that are given. The data that is extracted from these papers are
list afterward. Some papers that were left out, will be listed and the reasons for leaving them out
will be given to make clear why some papers do not meet the required desire.

Each of the papers found were tested using our inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria
were introduced to make sure the papers have the information required to anwser the RQs while also
being relevant with respect to their quality and age. Below a list of inclusion and exclusion
criteria is given. In general, for all criteria, the exclusion criteria take presedence over
inclusion criteria.
The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were used:

* Papers published before 2008 are excluded from the research, unless a reference/citation is used
for an unchanged concept.
* Papers with less than 15 references, excluding self-references, are excluded from the research.
* Selected papers should have an abstract, introduction and conclusion section.
* Papers stating the developers’ testing behavior are included.
* Papers stating the developers’ problems related to testing are included.
* Papers stating the technologies, related to testing analytics, which developers use are included.
* Papers writing about the expected advantage of current findings in testing analytics are
included.
* Papers with recommendations for future development in the software testing field are included.

The papers used in this paper were found by using a given initial seed of papers (query defined 
below as 'Initial Paper Seed'). From this initial seed of papers we used the keywords used by those
papers to construct queries, additionally the references (‘referenced by’) and the citations
(‘cited in’) of the papers were used to find papers. The query row of the tables describing the
references, as found below, indicates how a paper was found. For queries the default search sites
were Scopus, Google Scholar and Springer.

The keywords used to find papers were: software, test*, analytics, test-suite, evolution, software development,
computer science, software engineering, risk-driven, survey software testing

The table below describers for each paper, which Query resulted in which paper being found.
