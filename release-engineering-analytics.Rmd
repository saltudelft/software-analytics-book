# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
given that modern processes for releasing software (e.g. continuous delivery)
are industry-driven.
Therefore, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature
revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of
software analytics.
This will aid us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

### Search Strategy

At the start of this project,
five papers were given to us as a starting point for the literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The queries we entered are summarized in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to the search strategy that is based on a combination of keywords
and subject headings as described above, a review of the list of publications
that retrieved papers cite and are cited by is done.
These lists are provided by Google Scholar,
as well as the reference lists of the papers themselves.
Results of which are listed in Table 1.

### Study Selection

All papers that were found, were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).

In this tool, it is possible to label papers with tags
and leave comments and ratings.
Every paper is reviewed based on the selection criteria.
Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers
that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.

The selection criteria are as follows:

1. The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.
1. The study must not just show a release engineering technique,
   but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.

Based on these selection criteria,
the following papers appeared to be irrelevant for the scope of this survey:

<!-- Example. TODO: actually exclude papers -->
- [link to paper] - Excluded based on rule 2.

### Study Quality Assessment

Based on @kitchenham2004procedures, the quality of a paper will be assessed
by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale.
All levels of quality will be accepted, except for level 5 (expert opinion).

1. Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed
   randomised controlled trial.
2. Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials
   (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).
3. Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
    1. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and
       allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or
       interrupted time series with a control group.
    2. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control,
       two or more single arm studies,
       or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.
4. Experiments in artificial settings:
    1. Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
    2. Evidence obtained from case series,
       either post-test or pre-test/post-test.
    3. Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
5. Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.

Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias.
For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by @kitchenham2004procedures:

- Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups
  with respect to treatment.
- Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups
  apart from the treatment being evaluated.
- Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how
  outcomes are ascertained.
- Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in
  terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.

The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases.
This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase
to weigh the importance of individual studies [@kitchenham2004procedures].
