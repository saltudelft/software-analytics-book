# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
given that modern processes for releasing software (e.g. continuous delivery)
are industry-driven.
Therefore, we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature
revolving around the topic of release engineering from the perspective of
software analytics.
This will aid us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

### Search Strategy

Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around
the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics.
This aided us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five
papers as a starting point for our literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @d2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to querying search engines as described above,
references related to retrieved papers were analyzed.
For each paper, the review concerned the publications cited by the paper,
as well as those citing the paper.
These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the reference
lists in the papers themselves.
The results of the reference analysis are listed in Table 1.

_Table 1. Papers found indirectly by investigating citations of/by other papers._

| @mantyla2015a  | is cited by | @rodriguez2017a <br> @cesar2017a    |

In order to aggregate our collective efforts, selected sources were stored in a
custom built web-based tool for conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).

### Study Selection

By commenting on and tagging our findings we were able to export a filtered
list of publications,
the relevance of which was agreed upon.
