# Release Engineering Analytics

## Motivation

Release engineering is a discipline involved with making software available for
end users.
Efforts spent within the development environment of a software system
should eventually be integrated and deployed such that end users may benefit
from them.
In recent years, release engineers have developed and
adopted techniques to build infrastructures and pipelines which automate the
process of releasing software to an increasingly large degree.
These modern approaches have resulted
in various practices such as releasing new versions of a software system in
significantly shorter cycles.

Due to these developments being industry-driven, release engineering forms a
largely uncharted territory for software engineering research.
It requires the attention from researchers both because these new practices
have an often unanticipated impact on software studies and because they require
empirical validation [@adams2016a].

Therefore, this systematic literature review aims to provide an overview of
the software analytics research that has been conducted so far on release
engineering. Its main purpose is to identify the apparent gap
between research and practice, in order to guide further research efforts.

### Research Questions

Contrary to what is regularly the case, with release engineering, practice
seems to be ahead of research.
Building on this idea, our questions are constructed to identify in which ways
existing modern release engineering practices should still be studied in
software analytics research.
Our review thus aims to answer the following questions.

<!-- TODO -->
- **RQ 1:** _How is modern release engineering done in practice?_<br>
  This question aims to identify the so-called "state of the practice" in
  release engineering.
  We will summarize practices that have been adopted to drive release
  engineering forward. In addition we will identify the tools utilized to bring
  this about. Case studies will also be analyzed to this end.

- **RQ 2:** _What aspects of modern release engineering have been studied
  in software analytics research so far?_<br>
  In order to answer this question we investigate the practices that previous
  empirical studies have focused on. In doing so, we identify the associated
  costs and benefits that have been found, and the analysis methods used.

- **RQ 3:** _What aspects of modern release engineering make for relevant
  study objects in future software analytics research?_<br>
  In answering this question we aim to identify the gap between practice and
  research in release engineering. This way, our intent is not only to guide
  but also to motivate future research.

## Research Protocol

<!-- TODO -->
In this section, we will describe...

### Search Strategy

Since release engineering is a relatively new research topic,
we took an exploratory approach in collecting any literature revolving around
the topic of release engineering from the perspective of software analytics.
This aided us in determining a more narrow scope for our survey,
subsequently allowing us to find additional literature fitting this scope.

At the start of this project, we were provided with an initial seed of five
papers as a starting point for our literature survey.
These initial papers were @adams2016a, @da2016a, @da2014a, @khomh2012a, and
@khomh2015a.

We collected publications using two search engines: Scopus and Google Scholar.
These each encompass various databases such as ACM Digital Library, Springer,
IEEE Xplore and ScienceDirect.
The main query that we constructed is displayed in Figure 1.
The publications found using this query were:

- @kaur2019a
- @kerzazi2013a
- @castelluccio2017a
- @karvonen2017a
- @claes2017a
- @fujibayashi2017a
- @souza2015a
- @laukkanen2018a

_Figure 1. Query used for retrieving release engineering publications via Scopus._

In addition to querying search engines as described above,
references related to retrieved papers were analyzed.
For each paper, the review concerned the publications cited by the paper,
as well as those citing the paper.
These reference lists were obtained from Google Scholar and from the reference
lists in the papers themselves.
The results of the reference analysis are listed in Table 1.

_Table 1. Papers found indirectly by investigating citations of/by other papers._

| Starting point | Type        | Result                              |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| @souza2015a    | has cited   | @plewnia2014a   <br> @mantyla2015a  |
| @khomh2015a    | is cited by | @poo-caama2016a <br> @teixeira2017a |
| @mantyla2015a  | is cited by | @rodriguez2017a <br> @cesar2017a    |

All the papers that were found, were stored in a custom built web-based tool for
conducting literature reviews.
The source code of this tool is published in a
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/jessetilro/research).
The tool was hosted on a virtual private server, such that all retrieved
publications were stored centrally, accessible to all reviewers.

### Study Selection

In the utilized tool for conducting the survey, it is possible to label papers
with tags and leave comments and ratings.
Every paper is reviewed based on the selection criteria.
Based on this, the tool allowed to filter out all papers
that appeared not to be relevant for this literature survey.

The selection criteria are as follows:

1. The study must show (at least) one release engineering technique.
2. The study must not just show a release engineering technique,
   but analyze its performance compared to other techniques.

Based on these selection criteria,
the following papers appeared to be irrelevant for the scope of this survey:

<!-- Example. TODO: actually exclude papers -->
- [link to paper] - Excluded based on rule 2.

### Study Quality Assessment

Based on @kitchenham2004procedures, the quality of a paper will be assessed
by the evidence it provides, based on the following scale.
All levels of quality will be accepted, except for level 5 (expert opinion).

1. Evidence obtained from at least one properly-designed
   randomised controlled trial.
2. Evidence obtained from well-designed pseudo-randomised controlled trials
   (i.e. non-random allocation to treatment).
3. Comparative studies in a real-world setting:
    1. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with concurrent controls and
       allocation not randomised, cohort studies, case-control studies or
       interrupted time series with a control group.
    2. Evidence obtained from comparative studies with historical control,
       two or more single arm studies,
       or interrupted time series without a parallel control group.
4. Experiments in artificial settings:
    1. Evidence obtained from a randomised experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
    2. Evidence obtained from case series,
       either post-test or pre-test/post-test.
    3. Evidence obtained from a quasi-random experiment performed in an
       artificial setting.
5. Evidence obtained from expert opinion based on theory or consensus.

Also, the studies will be examined to see if they contain any type of bias.
For this, the same types of biases will be used as described by @kitchenham2004procedures:

- Selection/Allocation bias: Systematic difference between comparison groups
  with respect to treatment.
- Performance bias: Systematic difference is the conduct of comparison groups
  apart from the treatment being evaluated.
- Measurement/Detection bias: Systematic difference between the groups in how
  outcomes are ascertained.
- Attrition/Exclusion bias: Systematic differences between comparison groups in
  terms of withdrawals or exclusions of participants from the study sample.

The studies will be labeled by their quality level and possible biases.
This information can be used during the Data Synthesis phase
to weigh the importance of individual studies [@kitchenham2004procedures].

### Data Extraction
To accurately capture the information contributed by each publication in our
survey, we will use a systematic approach to extracting data.
To guide this process, we will be using a data extraction form which describes
what aspects of a publication are crucial to record.
Besides general publication information (title, author etc.), the form contains
questions that are based on our defined research questions.
Furthermore, the form contains a section for quantitative research, where
aspects such as population and evaluation will be documented.
The form that is used for this is shown below:

```

### Data Synthesis
To summarize the contributions and limitations of each of the included
publications, we will apply a descriptive synthesis approach.
In this part of our survey, we will compare the data that was extracted of the
included publications.
Publications with similar findings will be grouped and evaluated, and
differences between groups of publications will be structured and elaborated on.
In this we will compare them using specifics such as their study types, time of
publication and study quality.

If the extracted data allows for a structured tabular visualization of
similarities and differences between publications this we serve as an additional
form of synthesis. However, this depends on the final included publications of
this survey.

### Included and Excluded Studies

### Project timetable

The literature review was conducted over the course of four weeks. We worked
iteratively and planned for four weekly milestones.

### Systematic literature review on the impacts of agile release engineering practices

Reference: @karvonen2017a

General information:

- Name of person extracting data: Jesse Tilro
- Date form completed: 29-09-2018
- Author information: Karvonen, T. and Behutiye, W. and Oivo, M. and Kuvaja, P.
- Publication type: Journal/Magazine Article
- Journal: Information and Software Technology
- Type of study: Systematic literature review

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Agile release engineering (ARE) practices
    - Continuous integration (CI)
    - Continuous delivery (CD)
    - Rapid Release (RR)
    - Continuous deployment
    - DevOps (similar to CD, congruent with release engineering practices)


Are these practices to be classified under dated,
state of the art or state of the practice? Why?

- State of the art, for it concerns a state of the art report and was published
  recently (2017).

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Claims that modern release engineering practices allow for software
  to be delivered faster and cheaper should be further empirically validated.
- This analysis could be extended with industry case studies, to develop a
  checklist for analyzing company and ecosystem readiness for continuous
  delivery and continuous deployment.
- The comprehensive reporting of the context and how the practice is
  implemented instead of merely referring to usage of the practice should be
  considered by future research.
- Different stakeholders' points of view, such as customer perceptions regarding
  practices require further research.
- Research on DevOps would be highly relevant for release engineering and the
  continuous software engineering research domain.
- Future research on the impact of RE practices could benefit from more
  extensive use of quantitative methodologies from case studies, and the
  combination of quantitative with qualitative (e.g. interviews) methods.

### Modern Release Engineering in a Nutshell

Reference: @adams2016a

General information:

- Name of person extracting data: Nels Numan
- Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy): 28/09/2018
- Publication title: Modern Release Engineering in a Nutshell
- Author information: Bram Adams and Shane McIntosh
- Journal: 23rd International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (2016)
- Publication type: Conference paper
- Type of study: Survey

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Branching and merging
    - Software teams rely on Version Control Systems
    - Quality assurance activities like code reviews are used before doing a merge or even
      allowing a code change to be committed into a branch
    - Keep branches short-lived and merge often. If this is impossible, a rebase can be done.
    - "trunk-based development" can be applied to eliminate most branches below the master
      branch.
    - Feature toggles are used to provide isolation for new features in case of the absence of
      branches.
- Building and testing
    - To help assess build and test conflicts, many projects also provide "try" servers to
      development teams, which automatically runs a build and test process referred to as CI.
    - The CI process often does not run full test, but a representative subset.
    - The more intensive tests, such as integration, system or performance typically get run
      nightly or in weekends.
- Build system:
    - GNU Make is the most popular file-based build system technology.
      Ant is the prototypical task-based build system technology.
      Lifecycle-based build technologies like Maven consider the build system of a project to
      have a sequence of standard build activities that together form a "build lifecycle."
    - "Reproducible builds" involve for a given feature and hardware configuration of the code
      base, every build invoca- tion should yield bit-to-bit identical build results.
- Infrastructure-as-code
    - Containers or virtual machines are used to deploy new versions of the system for testing
      or even production.
    - It has been recommended that infrastructure code is to be stored in a separate VCS
      repository than source code, in order to restrict access to infrastructure code.
- Deployment
    - The term "dark launching" corresponds to deploying new features without releasing them to the
      public, in which parts of the system automatically make calls to the hidden features in a way
      invisible to end users.
    - "Blue green deployment" deploys the next software version on a copy of the production
      environment, and changes this to be the main enviroment on release.
    - In "canary deployment" a prospective release of the software system is loaded onto a subset
      of the production environments for only a subset of users.
    - "A/B testing" deploys alternative A of a feature to the environment of a subset of the user
      base, while alternative B is deployed to the environment of another subset.
- Release
    - Once a deployed version of a system is released, the release engineers monitor telemetry data
      and crash logs to track the performance and quality of releases. Several frameworks and
      applications have been introduced for this.

Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of
the practice? Why?

- The majority of these practices are classified by the paper as state of the practice, but state
  of the art practices are also mentioned.

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Branching and merging
    - No methodology or insight exists on how to empirically validate the best branching structure
      for a given organization or project, and what results in the smallest amount of merge
      conflicts.
    - Release engineers need to pay particular attention to conflicts and incompatibilities caused
      by evolving library and API dependencies.
- Building and testing
    - Speeding up CI might be the major concern of practitioners. This speed up can be achieved
      through predicting whether a code change will break the build, or by "chunking" code changes
      into a group and only compile and test each group once.
    - The concept of "green builds" slowly is becoming an issue, in the sense that frequent
      triggering of the CI server consumes energy.
    - Security of the release engineering pipeline in general, and the CI server in particular,
      also has become a major concern.
- Release
    - Qualitative studies are not only essential to understand the rationale behind quantitative
      findings, but also to identify design patterns and best practices for build systems.
        - How can developers make their builds more maintainable and of higher quality?
        - What refactorings should be performed for which build system anti-patterns?
    - Identification and resolution of build bugs, i.e., source code or build specification changes
      that cause build breakage, possibly on a subset of the supported platforms.
    - Basic tools have a hard time determining what part of the system is necessary to build.
    - Studies on non-GNU Make build systems are missing.
    - Apart from identifying bottlenecks, such approaches should also suggest concrete refactorings
      of the build system specifications or source code.
- Infrastructure-as-code
    - Research on differences between infrastructure languages is lacking.
    - Best practices and design patterns for infrastructure-as-code need to be documented.
    - Qualitative analysis of infrastructure code will be necessary to understand how developers
      address different infrastructure needs.
    - Quantitative analysis of the version control and bug report systems can then help to
      determine which patterns were beneficial in terms of maintenance effort and/or quality.
- Deployment
    - More emperical studies can be done to answer question like this:
        - Is blue-green deployment the fastest means to deploy a new version of a web app?
        - Are A/B testing and dark launching worth the investment and risk?
        - Should one use containers or virtual machines for a medium-sized web app in order to meet
          application performance and robustness criteria?
        - If an app is part of a suite of apps built around a common database, should each app be
          deployed in a different container?
    - Better tools for quality assurance are required, to prevent showstopper bugs from slipping
      through and requiring re-deployment of a mobile app version (with corresponding vetting),
      these include:
        - Defect prediction (either file- or commit-based)
        - Smarter/safer update mechanisms
        - Tools for improving code review
        - Generating tests
        - Filtering and interpreting crash reports
        - Prioritization and triaging of defect reports
- Release
    - More research is needed on determining which code change is the perfect one for triggering
      the release of one of these releases, or whether a canary is good enough to be released to
      another data centre.
    - Question such as the following should be investigated:
        - Should one release on all platforms at the same time?
        - In the case of defects, which platform should receive priority?
        - Should all platforms use the same version numbering, or should that be feature-dependent?
        - Research on the continuous delivery and rapid releases from other systems should be
          explored.

What research gaps does this publication contain?

- As is common with surveys, it does not contain the state of the field today. More quantitive and
  qualitive research has been done, which can not possibly be included.

### The Impact of Switching to a Rapid Release Cycle on the Integration Delay of Addressed Issues

Reference: @da2016a

General information:

- Name of person extracting data: Nels Numan
- Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy): 28/09/2018
- Publication title: The Impact of Switching to a Rapid Release Cycle on the Integration Delay of
  Addressed Issues
- Author information: Daniel Alencar da Costa, Shane McIntosh, Uira Kulesza, Ahmed E. Hassan
- Journal: 13th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories (2016)
- Publication type: Conference paper
- Type of study: Emperical study

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- To give a context to the study, the paper describes the concept of traditional releases, rapid
  releases, their differences, and how issue reports are structured.

Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of the practice? Why?

- State of the practice. The paper describes common practices that were in use at the time of the
  publication.

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- The study mentions that comparing systems with different release structures is difficult since
  one has to distinguish to what extent the results are due to the release strategy and which are
  due to intricacies of the systems or organization itself.

What research gaps does this publication contain?

- The main gap in this study is the specificity of the data. Only Mozilla has been considered, and
  external factors such as other organizational challenges which could have an effect on release
  time could not be included. More research that looks further into comparing this case to that of
  other organizations is needed.

Quantitative research publications:

- Study start date: Used data starts from 1999
- Study end date or duration: Used data ends in 2010
- Population description: The paper describes multiple steps to describe their data collection
  approach. The paper collected the date and version number of each Firefox release. Tags within
  the VCS were used to link issue IDs to releases. The paper discards issues that are potential
  false positives: IDs that have less five digits, issues that refer to tests instead of bugfixes,
  any potential ID that is the name of a file. Since the commit logs are linked to the VCS tags,
  the paper is able to link the issue IDs found within these commit logs to the releases that
  correspond to those tags.
- Method(s) of recruitment of participants: Firefox release history wiki and VCS logs
- Sample size: 72114 issue reports from the Firefox system (34673 for traditional releases and
  37441 for rapid releases)
- Evaluation/measurement description: The paper aims to answer three research questions:
    - Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
        - Approach: Through beanplots to compare the distributions, the paper first observes the
          lifetime of the issues of traditional and rapid releases. Next, it looks at the time span
          of the triaging, fixing, and integration phases within the lifetime of an issue.
    - Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
        - Approach: the paper groups traditional and rapid releases into major and minor releases
          and study their integration delay through beanplots, Mann-Whiteney-Wilcoxon tests,
          Cliff's delta, and MAD.
    - Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed
      issues?
        - Approach: the paper builds linear regression models for both release approaches. The
          paper firstly estimates the degrees of freedom that can be spent on the models. Secondly,
          they check for metrics that are highly correlated using Spearman rank correlation tests
          and perform a redundancy check to remove redundant metrics. The paper then assesses the
          fit of our models using the ROC area and the Brier score. The ROC area is used to
          evaluate the degree of discrimination achieved by the model. The Brier score is used to
          evaluate the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. The used metrics include reporter
          experience, resolver experience, issue severity, issue priority, project queue rank,
          number of impacted files and fix time. A full list of metrics can be found in Table 2 of
          the paper.
- Outcomes:
    - Are addressed issues integrated more quickly in rapid releases?
        - Results: There is no significant difference between traditional and rapid releases
          regarding issue lifetime.  Results:
    - Why can traditional releases integrate addressed issues more quickly?
        - Results: Minor-traditional releases tend to have less integration delay than
          major/minor-rapid releases.
    - Did the change in the release strategy have an impact on the characteristics of delayed
      issues?
        - Results: The models achieve a Brier score of 0.05- 0.16 and ROC areas of 0.81-0.83.
          Traditional releases prioritize the integration of backlog issues, while rapid releases
          prioritize the inte- gration of issues of the current release cycle.
- Limitations: Defects in the tools that were developed to perform the data collection and
  evaluation could have an effect on the outcomes. Furthermore, the way that issue IDs are linked
  to releases may not represent the total addressed issues per release. The results cannot be
  generalized as the evaluation was solely done on the Firefox system.
- Future research: Further research can look into applying the same evaluation strategy to other
  organizations that switched from traditional to rapid release.

- Journal: 2014 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution
- Publication type: Conference paper
- Type of study: Emperical study

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- This publication discusses the usage of issue tracking systems, and what the term issue means to
  form a context around the study.

Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of
the practice? Why?

- State of the practice.

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- The results based on the investigated open source projects may not be generalizable and
  replication of the study is required on a larger set of projects to form a more general
  conclusion. Another challenge is finding metrics that are truly correlated with the integration
  delay of issues.

What research gaps does this publication contain?

- Population description:
- Method(s) of recruitment of participants: The data was collected from both ITSs and VCSs of the
  studied systems.
- Sample size: 20,995 issues from ArgoUML, Eclipse and Firefox projects
- Evaluation/measurement description:
    - How long are addressed issues typically delayed by the integration process?
        - Approach: models are created using metrics from four dimensions: reporter, issue,
          project, and history. Please refer to Table 2 in the paper for all of the metrics
          considered. The models are trained using the random forest technique. Precision, recall,
          F-measure, and ROC area are used to evaluate the models.
- Outcomes:
    - How long are addressed issues typically delayed by the integration process?
        - Addressed issues are usually delayed in a rapid release cycle. Many delayed issues were
          addressed well before releases from which they were omitted. Many delayed issues were
          addressed well before releases from which they were omitted.
    - Can we accurately predict when an addressed issue will be integrated?
        - The prediction models achieve a weighted average precision between 0.59 to 0.88 and a
          recall between 0.62 to 0.88, with ROC areas of above 0.74. The models achieve better
          F-measure values than Zero-R.
    - What are the most influential attributes for estimating integration delay?
        - The integrator workload has a bigger influence on integrator delay than the other
          attributes. Severity and priority have little influence on issue in- tegration delay.

- Journal:
- Publication type:
- Type of study: Semantic study

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years until June 2014.
  This paper has performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies
  related to continuous development. The paper has found the following major points:
    - Almost all primary studies make reference in one way or another to accelerate the releae
      cycle by shortening the release cadence and turning it into a continuous flow.
    - Some reviewed publications claim that accelerating the release cycle can make it harder to
      perform re-engineering activities.
    - CD challenges and changes traditional planning towards continuous planning in order to
      achieve fast and frequent releases.
    - Tighter integration between planning and execution is required in order to achieve a more
      holisitic view on planning in CD.
    - It is important for the engineering and QA teams to ensure backward compatibility of
      enhancements, so that users perceive only improvements rather than experience any loss of
      functionality.
    - Code change activities tend to focus more on bug fixing and maintenance than functional- ity
      expansion
    - The architecture must be robust enough to allow the organization to invest its resources in
      offensive initiatives such as new functionalitity, product enhancements and innovation rather
      than defensive efforts such as bugfixes.
    - A major challenge in CD is to retain the balance between speed and quality. Some approaches
      reviewed by this study propose a focus on measuring and monitoring source code and
      architectural quality.
    - To avoid issues such as duplicated testing efforts and slow feedback loops it is important to
      make all testing activities transparent to individual developers.

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- Continuous and rapid experimentation is an emerging research topic with many possibilities for
  future work. This is why it's important to keep up with the newly contributed studies and add
  them to future reviews to compare their findings.

### Frequent Releases in Open Source Software: A Systematic Review

Reference: @cesar2017a

General information:

- Name of person extracting data: Nels Numan
- Date form completed (dd/mm/yyyy): 30/09/18
- Publication title: Frequent Releases in Open Source Software: A Systematic Review
- Author information: Antonio Cesar Brandão Gomes da Silva, Glauco de Figueiredo Carneiro, Fernando
  Brito e Abreu and Miguel Pessoa Monteiro
- Journal: Information
- Publication type: Journal
- Type of study: Survey

What practices in release engineering does this publication mention?

- This paper discussed the developments of continuous development over the years. This paper has
  performed a semantic study to identify, classify and analyze primary studies related to
  continuous development. The paper finds:
    - Two main motivations for the implementation of frequent software releases in the context of
      OSS projects, which are the project attractiveness/increase of participants and maintenance
      and increase of market share
    - Four main strategies are adopted by practitioners to implement frequent software releases in
      the context of OSS projects: time-based release, automated release, test-driven development
      and continuous delivery/deployment.
    - The main positive points associated to rapid releases are: quick return on customer needs,
      rapid delivery of new features, quick bug fixes, immediate release security patches,
      increased efficiency, entry of new collaborators, and greater focus on quality on the part of
      developers and testers.
    - The main negative points assocaited to rapid releases are reliability of new versions,
      increase in the "technical debt", pressure felt by employees and community dependence.

Are these practices to be classified under dated, state of the art or state of
the practice? Why?

- The practices discussed are a combination of state of the art and state of the practice approaches.

What open challenges in release engineering does this publication mention?

- A meta-model for the mining of open source bases in view of gathering data that leads to
  assessment of the quality of projects adoping the frequent release approach.
