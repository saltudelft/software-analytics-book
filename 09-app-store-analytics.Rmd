# App Store Analytics

## Motivation 

In the year 2008, the first app stores became available [@appStoreLaunch][@androidMarketLaunch].
These marketplaces have grown rapidly in size since then with over 3.8 million apps in the Google
Play store alone as of first quarter of 2018 [@appNumber]. These app stores, together with the
large amount of user-generated data associated with them present an unprecedented source of
information about the app ecosystem. Software developers and researchers use this valuable data to
gain new insights about how users use their app, what they like and the difficulties they
encounter. The same data can also be used by the store operators to detect malicious or misbehaving
apps whose behavior does not match the description. Because these app stores are relatively new,
the research field of App Store Analytics is still not mature. However, because apps are used so
much nowadays, it plays a vital role in the field of Software Engineering.
 
In 2015, Martin, William, et al., published "A survey of app store analysis for software
engineering" [@martin2015survey]. The paper divides the field of App Store Analytics into seven
categories: API Analysis, Review Analytics, Security, Store Ecosystem, Size and Effort Prediction,
Release Engineering, and Feature Analysis. Given that relevant literature on the field of App Store
Analytics has been already gathered and analyzed, it makes sense to use this chapter to go a step
further. We delve deeper into the subfield of Review Analysis. We started with the literature
proposed by Martin et al. in [@martin2015survey] and extended it with the relevant articles that
were published after 2015.  We then used the data to answer the following research questions:

* **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which topics that are being explored?
    - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
    - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

* **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
    - Case studies and their findings.

* **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

## Research Protocol

In this section, we explain the process that we followed to systematically extract the facts from
the articles for the literature survey. The search strategy section includes the queries that were
used, as well as the initial criteria that ware taken into account for the initial filtering of the
articles. Article selection explains how the relevance of the papers was assessed, and how the
final filtering was done. The last section describes the data extracted from each article.

### Search Strategy

As stated in the motivation, the survey by Martin et al. gave us a starting point.
Instead of gathering everything related to App Store Analytics we decided to focus on extending the
work done by the authors and answering the research questions specifically for the
subcategory of Review Analytics. All the papers that @martin2015survey
found related with Review Analytics were retrieved and inspected to get a sense of their specific
keywords and content. 

After doing this, the following search queries were generated:
```
“app store analytics” 
“app store analytics” AND “mining” 
“app store analytics” AND “user reviews” 
“app store analytics” AND “reviews”, “app reviews”
```

Google Scholar[^9], ACM Digital Library[^10], and IEEE Xplore[^11] were used for the searching
process with the queries mentioned above. In order to build a database using only the relevant
articles, the following inclusion criteria were applied to the found articles. In addition to the
results obtained by searching with the specific query, the first page of the “related articles”
link for the top cited articles was also inspected. 

| Criteria | Value        | 
|----------------|-------------|
| time frame    | 2015-present |
| journals and conferences | TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST, ICSE, FSE, MSR, OSDI, MobileSoft |
| keywords in title | user reviews OR app store reviews |
| keywords in abstract | user reviews OR app store reviews |

After the relevant articles were selected, their metadata was gathered, and they were entered into
a database. That was the input for the next step of the survey, article selection.

### Article selection

Taking into account that the papers considered in this survey were published from 2015, it is no
surprise that most of them are not highly cited. As a consequence, the selection of the filtered
articles does not take this into consideration. In contrast, each member of the group was in charge
of delving into a third of the database and finding, for each study, the *relevance* with respect
to Review Analytics and the proposed research questions. Then, this score was peer-reviewed by the
other two team members to achieve a consensus. 

For the *relevance* score, we considered how much the paper used the analysis of user reviews.
Next, we present three examples: 1) a highly relevant paper  score=10), 2) a somewhat relevant
paper (score=5) and 3) a non-relevant paper (score=0). 


**What would users change in my app? summarizing app reviews for recommending software changes
[@di2016would]** 
 - Relevance score: 10
 - Remarks: the authors applied classification and summarization techniques on app reviews to
   reduce the effort required to analyze feedback from users. As can be seen, the paper was focused
   on using the reviews to improve the development process.

**Fault in your stars: an analysis of Android app reviews [@aralikatte2018fault]** 
- Relevance score: 5
- Remarks: the authors analyzed the problem of the potential mismatch between the app reviews and
  the star ratings that the app receives. Although it is related to reviews, it is not its primary
  focus. It also does not push the state of the art regarding the datasets that they used. 

**Why are Android apps removed from Google Play? A large-scale empirical study
[@wang2018android]** 
- Relevance score: 0
- Remarks: in this case, the paper did not have to do with app reviews even though the title
  suggested otherwise.

In the end, only the articles that had a score of 5 or more were used for the fact extraction and
the subsequent answering of the research questions.

### Fact extraction

As was mentioned before, the articles were listed in a database in a structured fashion. The data
that was extracted has the following fields:

```
id for indexing
title
year 
relevance score 
relevance description 
source 
category
authors Information
source (journal or conference)
complete reference
```
Additionally, for each one of the articles, a systematic reading was carried in which bullet points
that answered the following questions were generated:

```
Paper type
Research questions of the paper
Contributions
Datasets: size and sampling methodologies
Techniques used for doing the analysis 
```

## Answers 

### **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
  - Which topics that are being explored?
  - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
  - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

To answer the question at hand we looked at the novel ideas and the research that has been done in
this field since that time. In their survey [@martin2015survey] Martin et al. proposed
“Classification”,“Content”,“Requirements Engineering”, “Sentiment”, “Summarization” and “Surveys
and Methodological Aspects of App Store Analysis” to categorize the existing literature. After
analyzing the subsequent work, we suggest new categories that reflect the state of the art in this
field. These are:“Review Manipulation”, “Requirements Engineering”, “Mapping user reviews to the
source code”, “Privacy / App Permissions”, “Responding to reviews”, “Comparing Apps and App Stores”
and “Wearables”. In the following sections, we expand on each one of these with the revised
literature.

**Review Manipulation**

Recently, significant attention has been paid to how the reviews and ratings can be used to
influence the number of downloads of a particular app in the App Store. The paper by Li et al.
[@i2017crowdsourced] analyzed the use of crowdsourcing platforms such as Microworkers[^8] to
manipulate the ratings. The authors merged data from two different sources, App Store and
crowdsourcing site, to identify manipulated reviews.

Chen at al. [@chen2017toward] proposes an approach to identify attackers of collusive promotion
groups in the app store. They use ranking changes and measurements of pairwise similarity to form
targeted app clusters (TAC) that they later use to pinpoint attackers. A different approach to the
same problem was proposed in [@xie2016you]. In the paper, Xie et al., identify manipulated app
ratings based on the so-called attack signatures. They present a graph-based algorithm for
achieving this purpose in linear time. 

These papers also show that the percentage of apps that manipulate their reviews in the app stores
is small --- less than 1 % of the apps were suspicious [@xie2016you]. Regarding the datasets, the
work by Li et al. [@i2017crowdsourced] used a smaller amount of app store data, but they merged it
with data from an external crowdsourcing site. In the case of the other two papers, they can be
characterized by the small number of considered apps (compared to the total number of apps in the
main marketplaces), but the significant number of reviews that were analyzed. That makes sense,
considering that the main purpose is to investigate the later. 


**Requirements Engineering**

Users use reviews as a way to express their attitude (positive and negative) towards an app. The
informative value of individual reviews is usually low, but as a whole, they can be mined for
knowledge usable in the improvement and advancement of the apps. The survey by Martin et al.
[@martin2015survey] described summarization, classification, and requirements engineering as
categories of the subfield of Review Analytics. These areas are converging and in recent work
(after 2015) summarization and classification, among other techniques, are being used to complement
the development, maintenance, and evolution of the apps.

In 2016, Di Sorbo et al. introduced SURF [@di2016would], an approach to condense a large number of
reviews and extracting useful information from them. In a subsequent paper Panichella et al.
[@panichella2016ardoc] presented techniques for classifying useful feedback in the context of
maintenance and evolution of the apps. In their work, the authors make use of machine learning
supervised methods in conjunction with natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis (SA),
and text analysis (TA) techniques. Unsupervised methods for review clustering were explored in a
paper by Anchiêta et al. [@anchieta2017]. The authors introduced a technique to categorize reviews
in order to generate a summary of the main bugs and features. Taking into account the high
dimensionality of the datasets that are used for review mining, Jha et al. [@jha2017mining]
proposed a semantic approach for app review classification. By using semantic role labeling, the
authors could make the classification process more efficient. Gao et al. presented IDEA
[@gao2018online]; a framework for identifying emerging app issues based on an online review
analysis. IDEA uses information from different time slices (versions) for identification of the
issues, and the changelogs of the studied apps as the ground truth for the validation of their
approach. It is the only paper in the reviewed literature that presents a case study (of deployment
in Tencent) as an example of the viability of IDEA. 

Most of the datasets used in the papers analyzed in this section can be characterized by a small
number of apps and a substantial amount of reviews. Di Sorbo et al. [@di2016would] used 17 apps and
3439 reviews. Anchiêta et al. [@anchieta2017] gathered more than 50000 reviews from 3 apps, but
after the preprocessing step the dataset was reduced to 924 records. Jha et al. [@jha2017mining]
used a structured sampling procedure to mix reviews from different datasets. The final size was
2917 reviews. Finally, Gao et al. [@gao2018online] used reviews from 6 apps (2 from the App Store
and 4 from Google Play), and the final dataset contained 164,026 reviews, one of the largest that
had been used.

**Mapping user reviews to source code** 

Another research direction that has become active in the past years is combining the results of
mining the app reviews with the source code to directly provide developers with valuable and
actionable information to improve their products. 

In [@palomba2017recommending], Palomba et al. presented a new approach called ChangeAdvisor. It
extracts useful feedback from reviews and recommends developers changes to specific code artifacts.
In the paper, metric distances such as the Dice coefficient are used in order to map a specific
subset of reviews to a section of the source code. Complementary work was presented in
[@palomba2018crowdsourcing]. In this study, Palomba et al. investigated the extent to which app
developers take app reviews into account.  To achieve this, they introduced CRISTAL.  It pairs
informative reviews with source code changes and monitors the extent to which developers
accommodate crowd requests from the reviews. 

Linting mechanisms and their effectivity have also been studied. Wei et al.  [@wei2017oasis]
proposed a method, OASIS, for prioritizing the Android Lint warnings. It uses NLP techniques
(tokenization, word removing, word stemming, and TF-IDF distance) to find the links between the
user reviews and the Lint warnings. According to the paper, this is relevant given that one of the
problems of linters is the number of false alarms they provide. 

Regarding the datasets that were used for validation even though the analyzed papers use a reduced
amount of apps (except [@palomba2018crowdsourcing] that used 100), as stated in the previous
section, they use numerous reviews (more than 20,000). Additionally, as the aim of the works in
this section directly involve the developers, they complement the quantitatively apps-reviews-based
experiments with qualitative ones. 

**Privacy / app permissions**

Since Android Marshmallow the Android operating system uses a run-time permission-based security
system. Apple's iOS also uses run-time permissions on top of a set of permissions enabled by
default. Scoccia et al. did a large-scale empirical study on this new system by inspecting 4.3
million user reviews from 5572 Google Play store apps [@scoccia2018investigation]. Using different
techniques they extracted 3574 user reviews that relate to permissions. They found that users like
the minimal permissions as most apps only ask for permissions they strictly need. Some of the
negative user concerns were apps asking for too many permissions or a bad timing asking for
permissions.

**Responding to reviews**

Since 2013 developers can respond to reviews in the Google Play store and Apple introduced the same
feature in 2017. In previous work, McIlroy [@mcilroy2014empirical] studied whether responding to
user reviews has a positive effect on the rating users give. Building on previous work McIlroy et
al. studied how likely it is for users to change their rating for an app when a developer responds
to their review [@mcilroy2017worth]. They found that users change their rating 38.7 percent of the
time when a developer responds to their review, with a median increase of 20 percent in rating for
the app.

Hassan et al. [@hassan2018studying] used 2328 top free apps from the Google Play store to study
whether users are more likely to update their review if a developer responds to their review. They
extracted 126686 dialogues between developers and users and concluded that responding to a review
increases the chances of users updating their given rating for an app can increase by up to six
times when compared to not responding. They also studied the characteristics, likelihood, and the
incentives of user-developer dialogues in app stores.

**Comparing Apps and App stores**

Papers that compare apps or app stores are discussed in this section.  Li et  al. mined user
reviews from Google Play to find comparisons between apps [@li2017mining]. They set out to identify
comparative reviews to extract differences between apps on different topics. For example, a user
says in a review that this app is not as good regarding power consumption than another app. Li et
al. created a method that with sufficient accuracy extracts these opinions and provides comparisons
between apps. 

Ali et al. did a comparative study on cross-platform apps. They took a sample of 80.000 app-pairs
to quantitatively compare the same apps across different platforms and identify the differences
between the platforms [@ali2017same].  
In a related study Hu et al. compared app-pairs that are created using hybrid development tools
such as PhoneGap [@hu2018studying]. With this approach, they found that in 33 of the 68 app-pairs
the star rating was not consistent across platforms. 

**Wearables**
User reviews can also be mined to understand user complaints. Mujahid et al. did this in a case
study on Android Wear [@mujahid2017examining]. More specifically, they sampled 589 reviews from 6
Android wearable apps and found that 15 unique complaint types could be extracted from the sample.
The sample was created from mining the reviews of 4722 wearable apps and selecting the apps that
have more than 100 reviews with a rating of one or two stars. After manually assigning categories
to the reviews in the sample they concluded that the most frequent complaints in this relatively
small sample were complaints related to cost, functional errors and a lack of functionality.

### **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:
  - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
  - Case studies and their findings.

A Large amount of work has been published in the field of app store analytics (The Survey by Martin
et al. was done on over 250 papers, and our study analyzed additional 80 papers), only a few of
them were case studies. After applying the article selection criteria, we were left with 30 papers
from which only two conducted a case study. The first case study of this selection, done by Mujahid
et al. [@mujahid2017examining], examines issues that bother the users of Android Wear. The second
one, done by Gao et al. [@gao2018online], reports on the performance of their review analytics tool
which was deployed at Tencent. This creates a large gap between the number of proposed solutions by
the researchers and the number of studies done on the solutions that had been deployed in practice.

#### State of the app stores

We were not able to find any academic publication on the solutions used by the actual app stores
(Google Play and App Store), but we have found that both app stores automatically detect fake
reviews [^1],[^2]. In 2016 Google deployed their review analytics solution, called Review
Highlights[^3], into production for both developers and customers, but at the time of writing this
survey (October 2018), the Review Highlights no longer show up in the public facing part of Google
Play Store and are only accessible in the developer console[^4].

#### State of the third-party tools
Many third-party services focus on app store analysis. They usually focus on showing aggregated
statistics from the app stores and some of them also analyze the user review. Tools such as
AppBot[^5] or TheTool[^6] perform sentiment analysis on the reviews and show it as an additional
metric next to the star rating. AppBot also categorizes reviews based on the keywords inside them.
It may seem like a low-tech approach, but it makes it easy for the users to reason about why a
certain review is assigned to a specific category. We were not able to find any third-party tools
that would use any of the advanced Machine Learning algorithms from the papers we analyzed. This
finding combined with Google hiding their Review Highlights may show that most of the algorithms
proposed by the researchers do not generalize very well in the real-world application and are hard
to comprehend by regular users.

To this day there are, to the best of our knowledge, no tools that compare apps and app stores
using user reviews. Some tools analyze apps and app performance, but no tools that do comparisons.

### **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

In this section, we present challenges and future research directions for the field of Review
Analytics and the subcategories that were identified in previous sections.

A significant aspect of the research process is the validation of the proposed tools and frameworks
and the assessment of how generalizable they are. To accomplish this, it is necessary to have
bigger datasets of reviews and more representative and sound samples. Machine learning has seen a
steady increase in popularity, however, not so much in the field of Review Analytics. Also, most of
the studies rely on correlation relationships to validate the effectiveness of their approaches.
There is a need to apply causation techniques so confounding factors can be ruled out.

There is a difficulty in translating the research into actual tools that are used in a real-world
setting. Of all the works that were considered, only Gao et al. presented a case
study[@gao2018online], and most of the tools from other papers have either disappeared or are not
being actively used.

*Review Manipulation:* It is important to combine multiple sources of data to identify suspicious
individuals better. Not just from app stores alone, but also crowdsourcing sites and even social
networks. Also, the sample should be carefully selected, given that the number of suspicious apps
is not significant (around 1% of all apps), taking into account the size of the app stores.

*Requirements Engineering:* More case studies are needed in order to validate how useful the
extracted requirements are in the context of software development. Also, as machine learning is
starting to be heavily used, models that are tailored to the review data will be created. The large
amounts of noise that is present in the reviews is still a challenge that needs careful studying of
the preprocessing steps that are used while assembling the datasets.

*Mapping user reviews to source code:* There is a need to understand the “language of source code"
better as this will be essential in combining the review and source code datasets. A likely future
trend is the analysis of update-level changes. Regarding this, there is still a need to obtain
update-categorized reviews as this is still a challenge with the current review-retrieving
approaches.

*Privacy/app permissions:* Quantifying and understanding the effects of run-time permission
requests on the user experience is still an open research area which can help to increase the
quality of apps. One of the directions for further research regarding permissions is the idea of
giving permissions to specific app functionalities instead of giving permissions to the app as a
whole. That could lead to better user-understanding why an app needs certain permission and could
reduce the number of permissions an app needs. Another possible future direction is researching and
creating tools that help developers put permission requests in the right place to avoid bugs
related to permissions and permission requests.

*Responding to reviews:* There is a need for an in-depth study of how developers and users are
using the review mechanism right now to find out how the mechanism can be improved. Right now
developers can respond to 500 user reviews per day using the Google Play API[^7]. It could be worth
investigating whether a limit of 500 responses is sufficient to ban useless responses from the
store such as thanking every user.

*Comparing Apps and App stores:* One of the open challenges is including indirect relationships in
the comparisons as only direct relationships were used in work by Li et al. [@li2017mining]. Next,
to this, it has been noted that apps that have been developed using hybrid development tools had
relatively low ratings. Future studies should be done to investigate the quality of hybrid apps and
compare them with the quality of native apps. Furthermore, to get more complete results, the
research should focus on a market-scale analysis using a large number of apps and reviews.
