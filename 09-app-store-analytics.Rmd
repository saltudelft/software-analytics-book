# App Store Analytics

## Motivation

In the year 2008, the first app stores became available. These marketplaces have grown rapidly in
size since then with over 3 million apps in the Google Play store alone at the time of writing
[REFERENCE]. These app stores together with the large user base associated with them provide
software developers and researchers with valuable data. The process of using the data from the app
stores to gain valuable insights is what we would call “App Store Analytics”. Because these app
marketplaces are relatively new, the research field of App Store Analytics is still not mature.
However, because apps are used so much nowadays, it plays an important role in the field of
Software Engineering.
 
In 2015, Martin, William, et al., published "A survey of app store analysis for software
engineering." In the paper, 7 main categories are proposed of the field: API Analysis, Review
Analytics, Security, Store Ecosystem, Size and Effort Prediction, Release Engineering and Feature
Analysis @martin2015survey. Given that relevant literature on the field of App Store Analytics has
been already gathered and analyzed, it makes sense to use this chapter to go a step further.  In
this order of ideas, we will delve deeper into the subfield of Review Analysis. We check the
literature proposed by @martin2015survey and update it with the relevant articles (as defined by
the inclusion criteria presented below) that were published after 2015.  We then use the data to
answer the following research questions regarding the chosen subcategory.

* **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which topics that are being explored?
    - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
    - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

* **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
    - Case studies and their findings.

* **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

## Research Protocol

TODO: write intro to search strategy

### Search Strategy

As stated in the motivation, the survey by Martin et al @martin2015survey gave us a starting point.
Instead of gathering everything related to App Store Analytics we decided to focus on updating the
work done by the the authors and using to answer the research questions specifically for the
subcategory of Review Analytics. In this order of ideas, all the papers that @martin2015survey
found related Review Analytics were retrieved and inspected to get a sense of their specific
keywords and content. 

After doing this, the following search queries were generated:
```
“app store analytics” 
“app store analytics” AND mining 
“app store analytics” AND “user reviews” 
“app store analytics” AND “reviews”, “app reviews”
```

Google Scholar was used for the searching process with the aforementioned queries. In order to keep
a database with only the relevant articles, the following inclusion criteria was applied to all the
hits. It is important to notice that in addition to the results obtained by searching with the
specific query, the first page of the “related articles” link for the top cited articles was also
inspected. 

| Criteria | Value        | 
|----------------|-------------|
| time frame    | 2015-present |
| journals and conferences | TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST, ICSE, FSE, MSR, OSDI, MobileSoft |
| keywords in title | user reviews OR app store reviews |
| keywords in abstract | user reviews OR app store reviews |
|----------------|-------------|

After the relevant articles were selected, their metadata was gathered and they were included in a
database. This is the input for the next step of the survey, article selection.

### Article selection
Taking into account that the papers considered in this survey were published from 2015, it is no
surprise that most of them are not highly cited. As a consequence, the selection of the filtered
articles does not take this into consideration. In contrast, each member of the group was in charge
of delving into a third of the database and finding, for each study, the *relevance* with respect
to Review Analytics and the proposed research questions. Then, this score was peer-reviewed by
other team member in order to achieve a consensus. 

For the *relevance* score, we took into account how much the paper actually involved the analysis
of user reviews. Next we present three examples: 1) a highly relevant paper (score=10), 2) a
somewhat relevant paper (score=5) and 3) a non relevant paper (score=0). 

**What would users change in my app? summarizing app reviews for recommending software changes
[@di2016would]** 

 - Relevance score: 10
 - Remarks: applied classification and summarization techniques on app reviews in order to reduce
   the effort required to analyze feedback from users. As can be seen, the paper was focused in
   using the reviews to improve the development process.

**Fault in your stars: an analysis of Android app reviews [@aralikatte2018fault]** 

- Relevance score: 5
- Remarks: TODO

**Why are Android apps removed from Google Play?: a large-scale empirical study
[@wang2018android]** 

- Relevance score: 0
- Remarks: TODO

At the end, only the articles that had a score of 5 or more were used for the fact extraction and
the subsequent answering of the research questions.

### Fact extraction

As was mentioned before, the articles were indexed in a database in a structured fashion. The data
that was extracted has the following fields:

```
id for indexing
title
year 
relevance score 
relevance description 
source 
category
authors Information
source (journal or conference)
complete reference
```
Additionally, for each one of the articles, a systematic reading was carried in which bullet points
that answered the following questions were generated:

```
Paper type
Research question of the paper
Contributions
Datasets: size and sampling methodologies
Techniques used for doing the analysis 
```

### Initial grouping of papers

## Answers 

* **RQ1** What is the state of the art in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which topics that are being explored?
    - Which research methods, tools, and datasets being used?
    - Which are the main research findings (aggregated)?

Since 2015 some interesting research has been done in the field of Review Analytics. To answer the
question at hand we looked at the novel ideas and the research that has been done in this field
since that time. In their survey @martin2015survey proposed “Classification”, “Content”,
“Requirements Engineering”, “Sentiment”, “Summarization” and “Surveys and Methodological Aspects of
App Store Analysis” as a way to categorize the existing literature. After analyzing posterior work
we propose new categories that reflect better the state of the art in this field. These are:
“Review Manipulation”, “Mapping user reviews to the source code”, “Privacy / App Permissions”,
“Responding to reviews”, “Comparing Apps and App stores and Wearables”. In the following sections,
we expand on each one of these with the revised literature.


**Review Manipulation**

Recently, significant attention has been paid to how the reviews and ratings can be used in order
to influence the number of downloads of a particular app in the App Store. In their paper,
@i2017crowdsourced analyzed the use of crowdsourcing platforms such as Microworkers to manipulate
the ratings. Is interesting to see how the authors merged data from two different sources, App
Store and crowdsourcing site, in order to identify manipulated reviews.

In @chen2017toward the authors propose an approach to identify attackers of collusive promotion
groups in the app store. They use ranking changes and measurements of pairwise similarity to form
targeted app clusters (TAC) that they later use to pinpoint attackers. A different approach to the
same problem was proposed by @xie2016you. In the paper, the authors identify manipulated app
ratings based on the so-called attack signatures. They present a graph-based algorithm for
achieving this purpose in linear time. 

In these works, it is interesting to see how the percentage of manipulated apps in the app stores
is not the majority of the used samples (@xie2016you found that less than 1% of the apps were
suspicious). Regarding the datasets, the work by @i2017crowdsourced used the smaller amount of app
store data. This, taking into account that they manage to merge it from data from an external
crowdsourcing site. In the case of the other two papers, they can be characterized by the small
number of considered apps (compared to the total number of apps in the main marketplaces), but the
significant number of reviews that were taken into account. This makes sense, considering that the
main purpose is to investigate the later. 

**Mapping user reviews to source code**

**Privacy / app permissions**

**Responding to reviews**

Since 2013 developers can respond to reviews in the Google Play store and Apple introduced the same
feature in 2017. In previous work McIlroy [Empirical studies of the distribution and feedback
mechanisms of mobile app stores] studied whether responding to user reviews has a positive effect
on the rating users give. Building on previous work McIlroy et al. studied how likely it is for
users to change their rating for an app when a developer responds to their review[Is It Worth
Responding to Reviews? Studying the Top Free Apps in Google Play]. They found that users change
their rating 38.7 percent of the time when a developer responds to their review, with a median
increase of 20 percent in rating for the app.

Hassan et al. [Studying the dialogue between users and developers of free apps in the Google Play
Store] used 2328 top free apps from the Google Play store to study whether users are more likely to
update their review if a developer responds to their review. They extracted 126686 dialogues
between developers and users and concluded that responding to a review increases the chances of
users updating their given rating for an app can increase by up to six times when compared to not
responding. Next to this, they also studied the characteristics, likelihood and the incentives of
user-developer dialogues in app stores.

Challenges & Future Research:
* in depth study how developers and users are using the review mechanism to find out how the
  mechanism can be improved.
* Investigate whether a limit of 500 responses is sufficient to ban useless responses from the
  store such as thanking every user.
* Clustering reviews

**Comparing Apps and App stores**

Papers that compare apps or app stores are discussed in this section.  Li et  al. mined user
reviews from Google Play to find comparisons between apps[@li2017mining]. They tried to identify
comparative reviews to extract differences between apps on different topics. For example, a user
says in a review that this app is not as good regarding power consumption than another app. Li et
al. created a method that with reasonable accuracy extracts these opinions and provides comparisons
between apps. 

Ali et al. did a comparative study on cross-platform apps. They took a sample of 80.000 app-pairs
to quantitatively compare the same apps across different platforms and identify the differences
between the platforms. [@ali2017same]  
In a related study Hu et al. compared app-pairs that are created using hybrid development tools
such as PhoneGap. [@hu2018studying] With this approach they found that in 33 of the 68 app-pairs
the star rating was not consistent across platforms. Challenges & Future Research:

**Wearables**

* **RQ2** What is the state of practice in Review Analysis? Specifically:
    - Which are the tools and the companies that create/employ them?
    - Case studies and their findings.

* Best practices for responding to reviews based on millions of reviews:
  https://support.appbot.co/help-docs/best-practices-replying-to-ios-and-google-play-reviews/.
  There are also tools such as AppSee which contain guides for responding to reviews and perform
  sentiment analysis of the user reviews. 
* To this day there are, to the best of our knowledge, no tools that compare apps and app stores
  using user reviews. There are tools that that analyse apps and app performance, but no tools for
  comparing.

TODO

* **RQ3** Which are the challenges and future research that the field is facing or will face?

**Summary (research questions and answers):** The paper proposes a new approach for analyzing App
Store user reviews, deriving insights from them. The presented solution has two components. First,
the User Reviews Model (URM) that enable the classification of users intentions (e.g., UI
improvements, bug fixes, etc.). Second, the Summarizer of User Review Feedback (SURF). A tool that,
by leveraging the URM, is capable of generating summaries of users feedback.  After evaluating the
proposed approach, TODO

**Research question/issue:** there is no approach that is able to do, at the same time, the
following: (i) determine for a large number of reviews the specific topic discussed in the review
(e.g., UI improvements, security/licensing issues, etc.), (ii) identify the maintenance task to
perform for addressing the request stated in the review (e.g., bug fixing, feature enhancement,
etc.), and (iii) present such information in the form of a condensed, interactive and structured
agenda of recommended software changes, which is actionable for developers. [@di2016would]


### API change and fault proneness: A threat to the success of Android apps

**Source:** Conference ESEC/FSE'17 Joint Meeting of the European Software Engineering Conference

William and Mary, USA

The paper presents an empirical study that aims to corroborate the relationship between the fault
and change-proneness of APIs and the degree of success of Android apps measured by their user
ratings. For this, the authors selected a sample of 7,097 free Android apps from the Google Play
Market and gathered information of the changes and faults that the APIs used by them presented.
Using this data and statistical tools such as box-plots and the Mann-Whitney test, two main
hypotheses were analyzed. The first hypothesis tested the relationship between fault-proneness
(number of bugs fixed in the API) and the success of an app. The second tested the relationship
between change-proneness (overall method changes, changes in method signatures and changes to the
set of exceptions thrown by methods) and the success of an app. Finally, although no causal
relationships between the variables can be assumed, the paper found significant differences of the
level of success of the apps taking into consideration the change and fault-proneness of the APIs
they use. 


**Research question/issue:** relationship between fault- and change-proneness of APIs and the
degree of success in Android apps.

**Summary (research questions and answers):** Multi-homing is not used by many developers, where
multi-homing is the strategy of releasing your application to multiple platforms. An analysis of
Google Play, App Store and Windows Phone Store shows that not many developers use this strategy.
Next to this, the paper found that the type and popularity of apps does not differ from those that
use a single-homing strategy.
 
**Research question/issue:** Analysis of multi-homing in different app stores. How much is it used
by developers and is there a difference in popularity?
